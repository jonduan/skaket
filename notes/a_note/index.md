Sometimes I want to write an email that I can easily reference and share in perpetuity, and messages of this variety often include code snippets. For this reason Skaket includes notes, which can be found at `http://[base url]/notes/[name of note]`. The yaml front-matter for this note is displayed below.

```yaml
